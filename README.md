# js-project

Languages: HTML, CSS, JS




Create a JavaScript Web-Project (instructions outline)

Please create a practice project using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

Please try to incorporate object oriented programming into your projects and use ES6 class syntax.

You do not have to access the DOM but you can

You are free to use any libraries you would like

You are free to copy code or use code along guides, but PLEASE MAKE NOTE OF YOUR SOURCES.
Think of any web development project as a research paper, you are allowed to use any freely available code as long as you make note of the source.
Since none of these projects are being used for commercial purposes you donâ€™t need to worry about having the correct licensing on a library, all of the freely available libraries are available for people to use in their own practice projects
